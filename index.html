		<p> <b>Our earth is unique planet.It is a life-supporting planet.</b><br>
		oviously, we need oxygen to breath, not only us but also all living beings including microorganism.<br>
		therefore, oxygen is very important for all living beings which is provided by plants. Oxygen is provided by plants so plants
		are also very important for all living beings. We should save plants and plant maximum number of green plants everyday.
		Nowadays, due to unwanted human activities, forest trees are cut down for various purpose. The practice of cutting trees is known as "Deforestation".
		It is a very bad practice and harmful for the environment. Forest covers about one-third of the Earth's land surface. Forest is a habitat for plants
		and animals, an agent for percolation and retention of water; maintaining ground water level;  prevention of soil erosion; maintaing air humidity;
		a source of firework, timber, fruits, lac,resins and medical plants.

	<h3><b>HUMAN BEINGS AND ENVIRONMENT</b></h3>
	
	<ul>
	<li> Response of living beings to changes in the environment; adaptation in plants and animals.</li1>
	<li> Modification of the environment by human beings to protect themselves against changes and meet their needs.</li2>
	<li> Effects of human activities and population growth on agriculture; harnessing of energy, housing, industrial development and other areas of consumption.</li3>
	<li> Consequence of human activities - stress on land use, water sources, energy and mineral resources, forest, ocean life; environmental degradation.</li4>
	</ul>
	
	<center>
	<p>Clearing forests for human use adversely affects many plant and animal species, they may become extinct.
         Human beings have always been dependent on nature for meeting the needs of foods, clothing and shelter.
         There remained virtualy a harmonious relationship between men and nature until a few centuries ago. 
         Scientific development and technological progress in the recent few centuries gave man the wrong notion
         that he was above nature and could become its master. Driven by these wrong notions, men began to use the 
         natural resources thoughtlessly in order to achieve the following aims:
	</p>
	</center>
    <ul>
		<li>To fulfill the requirments of a multiplying human population.</li>
		<li>To ensure protection adversities of nature.</li>
		<li>To speed up development and progress.</li>
		<li>To be called wealthy and civilised.</li>
		<li>To satisfy his desire to have and use more and more resources.</li>

	<p><b>The practice of cutting trees is known as "Deforestation".</b><br>
	<center>
	It is a very bad practice and harmful for the environment. Forest covers about one-third of the Earth's land surface.<br>
	Nowadays, due to unwanted human activities, forest trees are cut down for various purpose. We know that human beings depend on their environment to fulfill
	their needs. Thry use a variety of resources for their benefits. To obtain resources, they cause alteration in their environment. For example, they obtain
	wood by cutting trees, which plays a vital role in the Environment.Loss of forests on a large scale gradly influences the environment. This way, the environment
	undergoes further alteration. As we know, in the beginning of the human civilization, human beings cause changes in their environment which were quite
	insignificant.
